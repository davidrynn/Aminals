# Aminals
Side-project using SwiftUI and Combine to get animal gifs and present them.
Used combines DataTaskPublisher to asynchronously load data and update state on views.
Main views used SwiftUI with some necessary customization for sharing and gif images.
Currently loads from Giphy.  Will add gifs from Tenor and possibly Imgur.

# Installing
You will need to make a 'Constants.swift' file with api keys for Giphy
